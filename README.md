# GitHub Copilot Workshop for C++ Developers

## ex01-app-builder
Builds a console app that gathers up to 10 numbers, applies square and cube lambdas, and prints formatted results, then refactors into separate translation units  
(Path: ex01-app-builder/README.md)

## ex02-convert
Implements and practices numeric/combinatorics style conversion logic in C with emphasis on correctness and decomposition  
(Path: ex02-convert/README.md)

## ex03-enhance
Modernizes and strengthens a promise/future–based implementation, focusing on safer concurrency and cleaner abstractions  
(Path: ex03-enhance/README.md)

## ex04-fix-issue
Diagnoses and resolves a deliberate deadlock to reinforce thread synchronization concepts  
(Path: ex04-fix-issue/README.md)

## ex05-test
Introduces unit testing with doctest around a singleton-style logger, adding build and execution workflow  
(Path: ex05-test/README.md)

## ex06-pattern
Refactors monolithic code into a Template Method Pattern design while applying SOLID principles and adding tests  
(Path: ex06-pattern/README..md)

## ex07-db
Plans and scaffolds a C++ web API with a SQLite data layer, moving from architecture guidance to incremental implementation  
(Path: ex07-db/README.md)

## ex08-transform
Designs modular bit/data transformation utilities with clear documentation and testability  
(Path: ex08-transform/README.md)

## ex09-assembly-line
Implements all methods of a factory assembly line simulation class so provided tests validating throughput and state pass  
(Path: ex09-assembly-line/README.md)

## ex10-pipeline
Builds a multi-stage concurrent pipeline (generator, processor, aggregator) using threads, futures, and thread-safe queues with dedicated tests  
(Paths: ex10-pipeline/README.md, ex10-pipeline/doc.md)

## simulation
Creates an extensible manufacturing process simulation producing operational, quality, and what‑if analytics over daily/weekly runs  
(Paths: simulation/README.md, simulation/doc.txt)
