# GitHub Copilot Workshop using C++

## ex01-app-builder
Builds a console application that gathers up to 10 numbers, applies square and cube lambdas, and prints formatted results, then refactors into separate translation units  
(Path: ex01-app-builder/README.md)

## ex02-convert
Implements and practices numeric/combinatorics style conversion logic in C with emphasis on correctness and decomposition  
(Path: ex02-convert/README.md)

## ex03-enhance
Modernizes and strengthens a promise/future–based implementation, focusing on safer concurrency and cleaner abstractions  
(Path: ex03-enhance/README.md)

## ex04-fix-issue
Diagnoses and resolves a deliberate deadlock to reinforce thread synchronization concepts  
(Path: ex04-fix-issue/README.md)

## ex05-test
Introduces unit testing with doctest around a singleton-style logger, adding build and execution workflow  
(Path: ex05-test/README.md)

## ex06-pattern
Refactors monolithic code into a Template Method Pattern design while applying SOLID principles and adding tests  
(Path: ex06-pattern/README..md)

## ex07-db
Plans and scaffolds a C++ web API with a SQLite data layer, moving from architecture guidance to incremental implementation  
(Path: ex07-db/README.md)

## ex08-transform
Designs modular bit/data transformation utilities with clear documentation and testability  
(Path: ex08-transform/README.md)

## ex09-assembly-line
Implements all methods of a factory assembly line simulation class so provided tests validating throughput and state pass  
(Path: ex09-assembly-line/README.md)

## ex10-pipeline
Builds a multi-stage concurrent pipeline (generator, processor, aggregator) using threads, futures, and thread-safe queues with dedicated tests  
(Paths: ex10-pipeline/README.md, ex10-pipeline/doc.md)

## ex11-upgrade
Educational robotics codebase intentionally written with shortcomings to showcase modernization: Upgrade path from C++20 -> C++23; applying MISRA C++ / security hardening later; expanding minimal tests into a robust suite (property, fuzz, golden, coverage).

## simulation
Collection of scenario-based domain simulations (manufacturing, healthcare, banking) focused on extensible modeling, metrics generation, and what‑if analysis.  
(Base Folder: simulation/)

### simulation/manufacturing
Models a microchip production workflow (stages, yields, defects) enabling throughput, quality, and capacity scenario analysis.  
(Paths: simulation/manufacturing/microchips.md, simulation/manufacturing/README-chips-scenario.md)

### simulation/healthcare
Simulates patient flow and resource utilization (admissions, triage, treatment queues) to analyze bottlenecks and service-level outcomes.  
(Paths: simulation/healthcare/healthcare-scenario.md, simulation/healthcare/README-healthcare-scenario.md)

### simulation/banking
Represents banking operations (accounts, transactions, fraud checks, latency) to evaluate operational risk, performance, and scaling strategies.  
(Paths: simulation/banking/bank-scenario.md, simulation/banking/README-bank-scenario.md)
